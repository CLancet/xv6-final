Page 0 contains the text and data regions of the process.  The first three PTEs in the top-level page table are valid and point to second-level page tables.  The first three PTEs in the second-level page table at pa 0x0000000087f69000 are valid and point to third-level page tables.  The first PTE in the third-level page table at pa 0x0000000087f6b000 has permission bits 0x1f, which means read-only and executable.  This indicates that this page contains part of the text region.  The second and third PTEs in the same third-level page table have permission bits 0x0f, which means read-write but not executable.  This indicates that these pages contain part of the data region.
Page 2 contains part of the stack region of the process.  The last PTE in the top-level page table is valid and points to a second-level page table.  The last PTE in the second-level page table at pa 0x0000000087f6d000 is valid and points to a third-level page table.  The last three PTEs in the third-level page table at pa 0x0000000087f6c000 are valid and have permission bits 0x13, 0x07, and 0x0b respectively.  These indicate that these pages are read-write but not executable and contain part of the stack region.
When running in user mode, the process could not read/write the memory mapped by page 1, because page 1 is not mapped at all.  There is no valid PTE for page 1 in the top-level page table, which means that this region is unmapped and inaccessible.  This is consistent with Fig 3-4 from the text1, which shows that there is a guard page between the data and stack regions.
The third to last page contains part of the kernel code and data, which are shared by all processes.  The last PTE in the third-level page table at pa 0x0000000087f6c000 has permission bits 0x0b, which means read-write but not executable and user-accessible.  This indicates that this page contains part of the kernel data, such as trap frames and kernel stacks for each process.  The second to last PTE in the same third-level page table has permission bits 0x07, which means read-only but not executable and user-accessible.  This indicates that this page contains part of the kernel code, such as system call handlers and device drivers.
